- Wireframes and prototypes (page layouts incorporating design concepts, user experience, navigation, e-commerce components etc.)



- Technologies to be used. Will your group incorporate Bootstrap and jQuery?



- Research: take a look at other e-commerce sites; what components do they implement and why? Should you incorporate something similar? How would you go about doing so?

- Create your group Github repository and add a "project" using the automated Kanban template. Add your prioritized "issues" to the project. These should include all of the above 

- decisions you've made as a team. Be sure to create a readme.md file with your repo and provide a description of your website as well as the technologies used and any supporting links or resources. A link to the assignment will be given on the first day of this module.
